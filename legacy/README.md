# libWebKitLegacy on Summit's engine

The BWebView API that WebPositive and other Haiku programs are written
against (HaikuWebKit's `BWebView`, `BWebPage`, `BWebWindow`, `BWebDownload`,
`BWebSettings`, `BWebFrame`, `WebKitInfo`), implemented on Summit's WebKit
engine (`summit_webkit`: `BWebKitView`, `BWebKitContext`).

- `headers/` are HaikuWebKit 1.10.0's public headers. Class layouts and
  virtual functions are unchanged, so programs built for HaikuWebKit run on
  this library without being rebuilt. One difference: `BWebFrame::FindString()`
  takes option bits of its own instead of WebCore's `FindOptions`, and
  `WebFrame.h` no longer includes JavaScriptCore and WebCore headers.
- `src/` is the implementation. A `BWebView` holds the engine's `BWebKitView`
  as its child; its `BWebPage` is a handler of the application looper, as
  before, and turns the engine's notifications into the old listener
  messages (`LOAD_*`, `TITLE_CHANGED`, `UPDATE_NAVIGATION_INTERFACE`,
  `NEW_PAGE_CREATED`, `ICON_RECEIVED`, `B_DOWNLOAD_ADDED`...).
- `make` builds it on Haiku against the installed `summit_webkit`;
  `tools/package-summit-webkitlegacy.sh` builds the `summit_webkitlegacy`
  package, which replaces `haikuwebkit` and `haikuwebkit_devel`.

Summit's `docs/legacy-webview.md` describes what maps to what, what is not
available and how it was tested.

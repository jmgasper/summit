# WX 5100 media decoding

The port patch explicitly selects the `amduvd` Media Kit add-on on x86-64 for
progressive, eight-bit, 4:2:0 H.264 Baseline/Main/High streams within its size and
reference limits. The add-on performs the complete bitstream/device validation.
It registers no formats with Media Kit, leaving software decoding available.
`SUMMIT_HARDWARE_VIDEO=0` disables named hardware selection.

AMD supplies RGB32 using each picture's declared color range and matrix. The
Raspberry Pi retains its existing I420 path. Timeout and slow-close state is
tracked independently for each backend. Negotiated dimensions and row sizes are
checked before allocating the output buffer.

File playback recovers from a hardware decode error by seeking the extractor to
the keyframe preceding the next output frame, initializing software decoding,
and discarding pictures already returned. The replacement format must fit the
original bitmap. MSE retains compressed samples back to a keyframe, preserving
the preceding GOP while reordered output is pending. It replays those samples
through software and suppresses already consumed timestamps. The cache switches
to software at 512 samples or 64 MiB, retaining at most one additional demuxed
packet needed for recovery. Cancellation, interruption and normal EOF remain
separate from decoder failure.

## Native qualification, 11 October 2026

Focused tests compiled the actual amended `MediaDecoderSelectionHaiku.cpp` and
linked to the idle reference engine's WTF/Media Kit dependencies on X399. These
are decoder tests, not yet full-browser qualification. Both amended decoder
translation units pass native syntax checks. The complete private engine build and final incremental update now pass under
`/boot/home/wx5100/summit-webkit/WebKitBuild/WX5100`, with port patch SHA-256
`1a2476f9afeeaf0a50e335c52bb8f5af0070a3f65a6a24079e9ab7e344c1ac0e`.
The resulting private browser bundle is `bundle-6mitguy5`.

The focused native results are:

- A six-second 320×240 H.264 clip returns all 144 pictures through AMD UVD.
- Forced failures after 17, 47, 49 and 141 output pictures each resume in
  software and return all 144 pictures, with no duplicate or missing pictures.
  Output guards, monotonic track time, decoder identity and EOF checks pass.
- All hardware RGB pixels match independently decoded YUV and floating-point
  color conversion within one channel value of fixed-point rounding. Every
  software suffix matches FFmpeg RGB output exactly, including frame order.
- High 10 returns all 50 pictures in software; disabling hardware returns all
  144 pictures in software. A 2.75 s seek reaches the 2.5 s keyframe and returns
  all 84 remaining hardware pictures, with complete RGB/order comparison.
- Four additional 24-frame clips declare BT.601/BT.709 and limited/full range.
  All 96 pictures pass the same complete RGB comparison with maximum error one.

The production add-on was restored and its SHA-256 verified after fault tests:
`3f28945cffd89cad4cc5f093088c97b3e175b13355ffb63d1c9392d49728a9e6`.
The driver remains the qualified UVD clock build `49537626…`; these tests do not
change the driver or qualify general GPU rendering.

The workstation still had the obsolete NVIDIA `nvdec` add-on ahead of the
software decoder. With the GTX 1070 removed, it failed during track setup and
left Media Kit without a usable native track decoder. It is preserved outside
the add-on search path at `/boot/home/wx5100/retired-nvidia/nvdec`, SHA-256
`7c3e23e6b91d2c878d4d605d444c3227a498e761e0631f30338e269bf2b3b460`.
No Media Kit library replacement or media-server restart was needed.

Evidence is in the X399 lab's `evidence/wx5100` directory:
`summit-decoder-syntax.log`,
`summit-track-hardware-after-nvdec.log`, `summit-track-faults.log`,
`summit-track-rgb-comparison.log`, `summit-track-colors.log`, and
`summit-track-color-comparison.log`. Raw BGRA captures and MP4 fixtures are kept
alongside them. The complete build log is `summit-private-build.log`.

## Focused test tools

`tools/amduvd-test/build.py` builds the real file decoder test against an idle
reference build, writing only its specified output directory. Supply the amended
engine checkout with `--source` and the reference's generated Ninja directory
with `--reference-build`. Its `track-decode` executable accepts a video, expected
frame count, expected final decoder short name and a BGRA capture path; an
optional final argument seeks to a time in microseconds before decoding.

`make-fixtures.sh OUTPUT-DIRECTORY` creates the four color fixtures with FFmpeg.
`verify-rgb.py INPUT.mp4 CAPTURE.bgra` checks the entire picture sequence with
NumPy (tested with 2.2.6). `--fallback-after N` additionally checks the software
suffix, and `--start-frame N` checks a capture beginning at a seek keyframe.

`fault-addon.cpp` builds a **test-only** proxy. It loads the real add-on from
`SUMMIT_TEST_AMDUVD_REAL` and fails after the output count specified by
`SUMMIT_TEST_AMDUVD_FAIL_AFTER`. It must never ship or remain in a Media Kit
add-on directory. The lab run held its workstation lock, saved the real add-on,
used a restoration trap and checked the restored hash before proceeding.

The host SPS selection-parser regression builds the actual parser with ASan
and UBSan (`sps-parser-test.py --output DIRECTORY`). It reproduces an overflow
from an out-of-range signed scaling delta, then verifies rejection before
addition, both legal boundary values and 25,000 malformed configurations.
The correction and early cancellation check for cached MSE replay are included
in the completed private engine build; the earlier focused results above
describe commit `fc9cd5a`. `mse.html` now accepts `timeoutMs` for sustained playback and
long-GOP recovery checks.

Additional native fault tests reproduced two file-recovery failures: a failed
hardware seek reset stopped playback, and a decoder format rejected on one
read could still write into the caller's undersized buffer on the next read.
The corrected module switches to software after reset failure and latches
incompatible output geometry before any subsequent decode. It preserves the
bitmap's original format and retains fallback preroll across interrupted reads.

The reset-failure test seeks to the 2.5 s keyframe and returns all 84 remaining
software pictures, exactly matching FFmpeg RGB. The format test advertises a
smaller hardware output, fails before hardware writes, then checks three reads:
all reject the larger software output without changing any byte of the guarded
buffer. Both tests fail against the prior module and pass after the correction.
The normal 144-picture hardware run and all four mid-stream failure runs also
pass again, with the same complete RGB comparisons. Logs are
`summit-seek-format-{before,after}.log`, `summit-failed-seek-rgb.log`,
`summit-track-{faults,hardware}-v2.log` and `summit-recovery-v2-rgb.log`.

The fault proxy's additional test controls are `SUMMIT_TEST_AMDUVD_FAIL_SEEK`
and `SUMMIT_TEST_AMDUVD_BAD_WIDTH` (the latter only takes effect with
`SUMMIT_TEST_AMDUVD_FAIL_AFTER=0`). The track test's expected decoder value
`format-error` checks repeated rejection without output writes. The proxy is
restored to the real add-on and its hash verified after each test group.

Two additional native file fixtures pass using the current selection module
(`c96cb9c`). A 36-picture stream changes coded height 240 → 256 → 240 at IDRs,
with cropping preserving visible 320×240 throughout. A twelve-picture
Baseline stream uses POC type 2 and MMCO 5 on each of its eleven P pictures.
Both finish entirely on `amduvd h264`, preserve frame counts and timestamp
order, and match independently decoded RGB within one channel value.
The latter fixture also passes a direct native NV12 comparison with zero
differences; the cropped-height fixture passes 204 Media Kit output pictures
in NV12, I420 and packed YUV with exact pixels and timestamps. These fixtures
and comparisons live under `format-transition/` and `mmco5-fixture/` in the
WX5100 evidence directory. They do not yet qualify the full browser/MSE path.

For browser pixel checks, `mse.html` accepts `capturePausedFrame=1` with its
pause controls and includes a full-resolution PNG in the JSON result.
`verify-rgb.py --start-frame N --frame-count 1` checks the corresponding
decoded BGRA capture against that exact source picture without searching for
a matching frame.

The full browser's first MSE H.264 run completes all 144 pictures with zero
drops and no media errors. The trace names the AMD UVD decoder and contains
144 ordered output timestamps; the page reaches normal end, the browser quits
cleanly and the crash monitor reports no new crashes or syslog events. Evidence:
`probe-20261011-025740-summit-wx5100-mse144-llvmpipe` in this checkout's
`.vm/bench/`, and `summit-browser-mse144-llvmpipe.log` in X399 evidence.

Page rendering for these media tests uses a separate software Mesa prefix at
`/boot/home/wx5100/summit-mesa/prefix`: llvmpipe (LLVM 20.1.8), Mesa 25.3.6.
The original installed Mesa contains only Zink and cannot initialize EGL with
the old NVIDIA card removed. The private stack passes independent surfaceless,
pbuffer and threaded GLES pixel checks with zero mismatches. Its build log is
`summit-software-mesa-build.log`. This is CPU page compositing with hardware
video decoding; it does not establish AMD GPU rendering.

File playback also selects AMD UVD and reaches normal end with one startup
preroll picture plus 143 playback pictures, no media error and clean shutdown
(`probe-20261011-025822-summit-wx5100-file144`). File playback does not currently
implement the browser's playback-quality frame counters.

The MSE paused seek to 2.75 seconds holds an unchanged picture for 1.5 seconds
and resumes to normal end. Its full-size PNG matches source frame 64 within
one RGB value; the first MSE timestamp is 0.083333 seconds. Evidence:
`probe-20261011-025903-summit-wx5100-mse-paused-seek` and
`summit-browser-mse-paused-pixels.log`.

The analogous file test reproduced a seek-boundary error: at 2.75 seconds,
frame 65 was shown instead of frame 66 (file timestamps start at zero).
The saved PNG fails comparison with frame 66 and matches frame 65 within one
RGB value. The substitute decoder's current time denotes the returned
picture's end, so seek completion now requires that end to be strictly past
the target. This retains the native track's start-timestamp comparison.
The corrected hardware and software paths both pass the repeated pixel
check below. Before-fix evidence: `probe-20261011-025950-summit-wx5100-file-paused-seek`,
`summit-browser-file-paused-pixels-before.log` and
`summit-browser-file-paused-confirm65.log`.

With hardware disabled, the file seek has the same pre-fix boundary error:
its PNG matches frame 65 exactly and fails frame 66. The software timestamp
workaround also supplies a frame-end counter. It now reports that distinction
to the seek loop, which applies the strict boundary comparison only to such
counters and preserves start-timestamp semantics otherwise. Evidence:
`probe-20261011-030538-summit-wx5100-file-paused-sw-before`,
`summit-browser-file-paused-sw-pixels-before.log` and
`summit-browser-file-paused-sw-confirm65.log`. The independent pixel test ran
while browser packaging was active; no performance result is claimed for it.

The updated hardware file seek now captures frame 66 at 2.75 seconds with
maximum RGB error one, holds it unchanged and resumes to normal end
(`probe-20261011-030640-summit-wx5100-file-paused-seek-after`,
`summit-browser-file-paused-pixels-after.log`).

Full-browser High 10 fallback returns all 50 pictures in software. An injected
MSE hardware failure after picture 47 returns all 144 pictures with no drops;
every output timestamp matches the source in order, without gaps or repeats.
Both runs had concurrent build activity, so these establish correctness, not
uncontended throughput. Runs: `probe-20261011-030742-summit-wx5100-high10-software`
and `probe-20261011-030839-summit-wx5100-mse-fault47`.

Failure on the first Decode call exposed a different MSE recovery gap: the
addon had requested no packets, so the empty replay cache incorrectly caused
a fatal media error. Recovery now starts software directly from the untouched
queue in that case; after any consumed input/output it still requires a saved
keyframe. Before-fix evidence is
`probe-20261011-030919-summit-wx5100-mse-fault0-seek`. Final bundle
`bundle-uza681dk` (commit `8b5369e`, patch `d386c022...`) passes the repeated
startup/seek failure case and captures source frame 64 exactly in software,
then ends normally (`probe-20261011-031916-summit-wx5100-mse-fault0-seek-after`).
Each injected-failure run restored the real addon and verified its original
SHA-256 before ending.

The software file seek also passes at exactly 2.75 seconds (source frame 66,
exact RGB). Hardware at 2.74 seconds correctly shows frame 65 within one RGB
value. File failure after 47 hardware pictures recovers to software and ends
with one preroll plus 143 playback pictures. An injected failed startup seek
reset also recovers; the later paused seek still shows frame 66 exactly.
This reset injection occurs at startup, not after playback has begun. Evidence:
`probe-20261011-031211-summit-wx5100-file-paused-sw-after`,
`probe-20261011-031536-summit-wx5100-file-fault47`,
`probe-20261011-031605-summit-wx5100-file-seek-reset-fallback`, and
`probe-20261011-031632-summit-wx5100-file-seek-between-frames`.

The 540-picture long-GOP MSE test reaches the bounded recovery cache limit,
replays 513 samples in software and emits all source timestamps exactly once.
It drops two late pictures while a build is active, so establishes recovery
correctness rather than uncontended performance
(`probe-20261011-031114-summit-wx5100-mse-cache512`).

Full HD exposed scalar RGB conversion as a throughput limit: native decoding
of 900 pictures takes 33.866 seconds and browser playback drops frames.
Haiku commit `fb4755dc24`, addon SHA `818ef96c...`, adds exact SSE4.1 RGB
conversion, reducing direct decode to 27.568 seconds. Native 144-picture
small and 24-picture HD captures match independent references within one RGB
value. With this candidate the browser plays all 900 1080p30 pictures and
unmuted AAC with zero drops and exact source timestamps
(`probe-20261011-033006-summit-wx5100-hd900-audio-simd`).

The three-minute test with the same candidate reaches normal end and decodes
all 5,400 source timestamps, but drops 72 pictures during presentation
(`probe-20261011-033151-summit-wx5100-hd5400-audio-simd`). There is no foreign
load, media error, new crash or GPU fault. Trace timing shows short decode
bursts exceeding one frame interval. The video loop currently waits for each
picture's presentation before decoding its successor, leaving no accumulated
margin despite average decode capacity above 30 fps. Production addon
`3f28945c...` was restored and verified after both candidate test groups.

The next engine candidate decouples decoding and presentation with a separate
presentation thread and a queue bounded to six pictures and 64 MiB (an
otherwise empty queue can accept one larger picture). Flush clears queued
pictures, wakes blocked producers, and serializes generation changes against
publication so an old picture cannot satisfy a new seek's preroll. The
existing clock and 80 ms late-frame policy are unchanged.

This engine (`3c739a4`, patch `b782abfd...`, `bundle-x50jiwz8`) passes the same
three-minute HD/AAC test with all **5,400 frames and zero drops**, all source
PTS in order, normal end and clean shutdown. All 17 load samples are
uncontended; mean owned CPU load is 0.746 cores. AAC queues 8,650,752 PCM
frames at 48 kHz stereo. The 116.3 ms reported output latency is not a
physical A/V measurement. No new crash, GPU fault or leftover process is
recorded. The saved screenshot shows the movie and `q=5400/0`.

Paused seeking still holds the correct source frame 64 at 2.75 seconds
(maximum RGB error one), then resumes without drops. High 10 software
fallback returns all 50 pictures with zero drops. Runs:
`probe-20261011-034254-summit-wx5100-readahead-paused-seek`,
`probe-20261011-034320-summit-wx5100-readahead-hd5400-audio`, and
`probe-20261011-034657-summit-wx5100-readahead-high10`.
The test group restores and verifies production addon `3f28945c...`.

The page's optional `maxDropped=0` makes zero drops an explicit pass
condition, independently of `expectedFrames` (whose total includes drops).
The queued renderer also passes four uncontended regressions with zero drops:
hardware failure after picture 47 (all 144 source timestamps, 13 compressed
samples replayed), first-call failure both at startup and after paused seek
(frame 64 exact software RGB), bounded-cache fallback (513 samples replayed,
all 540 output timestamps in order), and pause/resume without seeking (144
frames, time/pixels/counter unchanged during the pause). Every run ends
normally, drains its processes and records no crash or GPU fault. The real
addon is restored after each fault injection. Runs:
`probe-20261011-034728-summit-wx5100-readahead-fault47`,
`probe-20261011-034756-summit-wx5100-readahead-fault0-seek`,
`probe-20261011-034824-summit-wx5100-readahead-cache512`, and
`probe-20261011-034905-summit-wx5100-readahead-pause`.

HEVC selection now names decoder index 1 of `amduvd`; H.264 remains index 0.
The hvcC prefilter admits Main/Main 10, 4:2:0 and matching 8/10-bit planes,
with complete SPS/PPS/device validation still performed by the addon. An
older addon without index 1, unsupported configuration or missing device
keeps the existing software fallback. The native prerequisite is Haiku
`a5278702e5`, driver `8fc0041e...`, which corrects P010 firmware pitch units.
The combined addon `818ef96c...` has passed 648 captured Media Kit pictures
across formats, seeks and recovery, plus a 540-picture Main-10 POC-wrap test;
HEVC browser playback is awaiting its new bundle.

The MSE fixture accepts `videoCodec` so HEVC fragments are declared with their
actual codec string. The RGB reference checker now reads native ten-bit YUV
and applies ten-bit code ranges without reducing precision; it passes all
48 captured Main-10 RGB pictures within one channel value and repeats the
existing eight-bit paused-frame check. Reference decoding trims to a requested
frame interval, avoiding a whole HD clip allocation for one paused capture.

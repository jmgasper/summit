# Signed CRX3 extension import

Summit's modern extension-enabled browser imports CRX3 packages through
**Window → Extensions… → Add extension…**. Before presenting consent, the engine
verifies the package signature, extracts its authenticated ZIP payload, and
prepares an immutable resource snapshot. A verified signature does not establish
Chrome Web Store provenance or extension compatibility. Requested access still
requires the user's approval.

The verified developer public key determines the 32-letter Chrome extension ID.
This identity takes precedence over a manifest key or Gecko ID inside that CRX.
The public SDK returns it as `verified_crx_id` in the preparation receipt and
rejects activation under any other identity. ZIP/XPI packages and folders return
an empty value and retain the existing manifest/local identity rules. Neither
format nor the choice of `chrome` versus `browser` namespace selects a complete
API compatibility profile yet.

The installation retains the original CRX bytes. Startup prepares and verifies
that package again, then restores saved approval only if its resource fingerprint
matches. Corruption is rejected. A valid signature over changed resources still
requires fresh approval; this does not implement automatic extension updates.

## Verification and extraction

The verifier follows the CRX3 wire format and
[Chromium's verifier implementation](https://github.com/chromium/chromium/blob/main/components/crx_file/crx_verifier.cc).
RSA proofs use PKCS#1 v1.5 with SHA-256; ECDSA proofs use SHA-256. The historical
PSS comment in [crx3.proto](https://github.com/chromium/chromium/blob/main/components/crx_file/crx3.proto)
does not describe the RSA algorithm used by Chromium's implementation.
Every supplied RSA/ECDSA proof must verify, and at least one developer key must
match the signed ID. Signatures cover the exact signed-header bytes and complete
ZIP payload. The reader bounds header size, proof count, key/signature sizes,
varints, field lengths and nested unknown protobuf groups.

Extraction passes only the authenticated ZIP slice to libzip. CRX input is read
into an immutable buffer and checked for source changes. The existing path,
entry-type, duplicate-name, CRC, expansion and cleanup checks remain enforced.
Ordinary ZIP/XPI inputs retain `ZIP_CHECKCONS`. Signed CRX uses libzip's normal
read mode: the published uBlock CRX has local/central ZIP version metadata that
libzip's additional consistency mode rejects, although its payload is readable.
The signed hostile-archive tests cover this separate path.

CRX2, Mozilla XPI signature validation, store publisher authentication, Safari
bundles and complete browser-specific API semantics remain unfinished.

## Native results

The verified engine patch is
`d5887e4f3e31b5c580a90cd501a9917853bfffccd32fe5a239fe6a8da6bd809c`.
The full engine and browser built with unchanged inputs as native bundle
`/SummitExtensions/summit/build-modern-browser/bundle-d0h_6xzg`.
The frozen build report is `.vm/modern-browser-crx-import-bundle-result.json`
(SHA-256 `09a7a136584e8e57178efd81988b24cd40ae71a123e01d89df87526d481b6310`).

The production verifier/extractor passes **620 native checks**: 201 signature
checks, 308 CRX extraction checks, and all 111 existing ZIP/XPI checks. These
include independent RSA/ECDSA signatures, invalid extra proofs, tampering,
malformed protobuf, signed hostile ZIPs, and all 779 resources of the unmodified
published uBlock Origin 1.74.0 CRX. The native result is
`.vm/native-crx-f2f77ff6607354eb7945469a/result.json`.

The public SDK and actual browser pass **205 checks**:

- 72 SDK checks establish signer propagation, rejection of conflicting caller
  IDs, immutable prepared snapshots, RSA/ECDSA execution, resource bytes,
  storage across reload and complete snapshot cleanup. The unmodified uBlock
  package prepares with ID `fkgkibajhfbepljeaefdnfnegdcjomkh`; this run does not
  execute uBlock or test its filtering.
- 78 installation checks exercise the native picker, corrupt-package rejection,
  signature/provenance consent text, cancellation, installation despite a
  conflicting manifest ID, actual runtime ID and popup execution.
- Four further browser processes pass 17, 10, 11 and 17 checks respectively:
  startup restores saved state; corruption prevents startup; a newly signed
  update requires approval; restoring the original bytes restores the runtime
  without an extra background boot from either rejected package.

All six process groups exit normally and drain without forced cleanup. The
native debugger-log interval is clean. Source, bundle, fixture, original CRX
and approved catalog checks pass. Consent and restored-popup screenshots were
also inspected. The runtime result is
`.vm/modern-extension-crx-cbeaee46835bcb92b29d31eb/result.json`
(SHA-256 `e36bcdd03c6686514cb92e311d53991b88f68be6f63853d2e0d4b7281c2f6b57`).

All three host CTest suites pass, including 34 identity checks. The production
signature verifier passes its 201 host checks under AddressSanitizer and
UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer; the runtime fixture envelopes add 16 passing checks.

The unchanged published Chromium MV2 Dark Reader 4.9.131 package also passes
all **78 native checks** on this bundle, including initial injection into an
already-open page, popup On/Off, and disable/re-enable. Its result is
`.vm/modern-darkreader-ef4aa1354e5979354fb9a707/result.json`
(SHA-256 `c64cd8b4237c0596c30ba2c0e271519ce3b699ad9d1aaea2c2d6b1bdffa11988`),
with unchanged package/bundle inputs, a clean debugger-log interval and no
forced cleanup.

## Reproduce

The host fixture generators require Python's `cryptography` package (tested
with 41.0.7). Each generation creates fresh ephemeral signing keys; freeze the
resulting directories for the duration of a run. The published package is
checked against its existing corpus pin.

```sh
python3 tools/fetch-extension-corpus.py
python3 tools/test-engine-extension-crx-fixtures.py .vm/crx-fixtures
python3 tools/test-modern-extension-crx-fixtures.py .vm/crx-runtime-fixtures
python3 tools/test-engine-extension-crx.py \
  --fixtures .vm/crx-fixtures --bundle /absolute/guest/bundle
python3 tools/test-modern-extension-crx.py \
  --fixtures .vm/crx-runtime-fixtures --archive-fixtures .vm/crx-fixtures \
  --bundle /absolute/guest/bundle --watch
```

Run native integration suites serially with other browser/crash-log tests.
`--suite sdk` or `--suite browser` selects a narrower runtime run;
`--compile-only` verifies harness compilation without executing extensions.
The broader [browser and extension requirements](REQUIREMENTS.md) remain active.

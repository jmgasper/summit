# Native extension test reporting

Haiku's controller handles the seven existing test-report messages: assertion,
equality, log, message, added, started and finished. Each produces a
`WebExtension test: ` log line followed by a JSON object. Reports retain source
URL and line number, result flags, test names, messages and equality operands as
applicable. The message argument is retained as serialized JSON in `argumentJSON`.
Empty-message defaults match Cocoa's fallback reporting.

JSON escaping keeps embedded newlines and control characters inside one report.
`WTFLogAlways` keeps test reports available when release-log channels are disabled.
The existing seven `inTestingMode` IPC validators are unchanged. Cocoa's delegate
implementation is unchanged; native host callbacks and replies remain future work.

The final native source compiles with both extension features enabled and
regenerated IPC in `.vm/extension-lifecycle-inputs.uLPqVdtI/result.json`.
Its source hash matches the candidate, and native inputs/configuration remain
unchanged. `.vm/extension-test-reporting-extraction.json` records the unchanged
method signatures and message validators. No test-report IPC or extension test
was executed; this is compile evidence only.

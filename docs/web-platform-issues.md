# Web platform issues, October 2026

Issues #25–30 are implemented. The verified build `bundle-1gm22c31` was installed
on the X399 on October 6, 2026, using private Mesa `prefix-20261002`. Both
`/boot/home/Desktop/Summit-current.sh` and `/boot/home/summit/Summit-installed`
point to it. The previous launcher is backed up. An existing browser instance
keeps its original libraries until restarted.

The bundled engine patch SHA-256 is
`2cfb95568767c2cf33da4659514d55cca851a06ffd761344474341b74b6d9c72`.
The engine, WebProcess, NetworkProcess and native browser all build successfully
on the workstation. Bundle creation verifies source hashes, the completed
engine and the private dependency closure.

## Results

| Issue | Result | Verification |
| --- | --- | --- |
| #25 Fullscreen | DOM requests enter and leave native fullscreen | 9/9 browser checks; Escape restores DOM, native state and original frame; tab switching/opening/closing, navigation and renderer termination restore the window |
| #26 Image formats | JPEG XL and HEIC decoding; JPEG XR decoding and encoding | 20/20 integrated pixel, alpha, ImageBitmap and encoding checks; 256 native JPEG XR codec checks |
| #27 OffscreenCanvas | Main-thread and worker 2D, WebGL and WebGL2 | 28/28 checks, including concurrent GPU rendering, placeholder presentation and transferred ImageBitmap pixels |
| #28 Custom schemes | Recommended native apps, application selection and website handlers | 18/18 API validation checks; approved website round trip 19/19; native argument delivery, remembering, cancellation, stale replies, removal and private isolation |
| #29 WebUSB | Window bindings, native chooser, origin grants and native transfer backend | 54/54 browser checks; 550 policy checks; native protected-device and closed-session guards; real chooser click returns NotFoundError with no eligible devices |
| #30 Toolbar icons | Native scalable HVIF toolbar resources | All normal/disabled icon variants and complete native toolbar visually checked |

Five consecutive OffscreenCanvas and image-codec runs pass with no new crash
reports or debugger events. The final installed desktop launcher was also
started with an isolated profile: OffscreenCanvas 28/28 and image codecs 20/20
pass, and the browser and helpers close cleanly. All four portable CTest suites
pass.

**Physical USB transfer validation is deferred to a future goal at the user's
request.** No eligible test device is attached. The keyboard, Bluetooth adapter
and root hubs were not opened for transfers.

## Implementation notes

Fullscreen uses an acknowledged WebFullScreenManagerProxy transition on the
native window looper, with a five-second timeout. The window saves its normal
frame, look, flags and visible controls. A temporary notice identifies the URL
and Escape key. Its maximum width is unrestricted, so it fills the X399's
3840×1080 display. Session persistence retains the normal window frame. No
additional air/OS change was necessary.

OffscreenCanvas build switches now explicitly migrate retained CMake caches,
and Haiku enables the separate AllowWebGLInWorkers runtime preference. Worker
ANGLE contexts use distinct virtualization groups and do not share the
compositor's native context. Display readback samples the presented texture,
fixing transparent-black output after buffer swaps with antialiasing disabled.
Worker image handoffs use CPU-backed intermediate buffers because Skia GPU
images belong to their creating GrDirectContext. WebGL rendering itself stays
accelerated; the handoff correction also eliminates the observed worker
teardown crash in repeated testing.

Image dependencies are private and checksum-pinned: libjxl 0.12.0, libheif
1.23.6, libde265 1.1.3 and Debian-patched jxrlib 1.2. Preparation and bundling
retain manifests and licenses without replacing OS packages. HEIC decoding
handles dimensions, crops/rotation, alpha and ICC conversion with bounded
allocations. JPEG XR has bounded in-memory encode/decode helpers and a Skia
canvas export path, including GPU readback. Independent binary fixtures are
in `tests/fixtures/image-codecs`.

Protocol handlers validate schemes, templates, committed frame ownership and
same-origin HTTP(S) targets. Website registration requires a native approval
prompt. External links offer Haiku's MIME-recommended application or a file
chooser; BRoster receives the original URL as one argument, without a shell.
Preferences › Link Handlers removes saved choices and denials. Private changes
stay in memory, and stale/background-tab prompt replies do nothing.

WebUSB exposes the Window interfaces, descriptor/result objects, device
operations and connection events. The UI process independently checks frame
ownership, committed origins, activation, filters, transfer limits and leases.
Grants are per-origin and per-browsing-context/session, with separate private
contexts. Native operations cover configuration, alternate interfaces, control,
bulk, interrupt and isochronous transfers; navigation and closure cancel
outstanding work. Transfers are limited to 16 MiB and have a ten-second native
deadline. The device blocklist and every alternate interface's protected class
are checked. Haiku lacks exclusive kernel interface claims, so a composite
device containing any protected interface is excluded as a whole.

Current WebUSB limits: access is restricted to the top-level origin and
same-origin children allowed by Permissions Policy; WorkerNavigator.usb is not
exposed. Haiku has no raw USB reset command, so reset reports NotSupportedError.
USB's permissions-policy value is included in IPC serialization, and transfer
result constructors preserve their supplied DataView objects through GC-traced
attribute caches.

Toolbar icons are native HVIF resources rendered at the display scale, with
BControl's pressed and disabled variants. Back, Forward, Stop and Home come
from Haiku WebPositive; the remaining toolbar vectors are Summit resources.

## Reproducing validation

Serve the repository root on the workstation's loopback address or HTTPS and
open the pages under `tools/bench/pages`:

- `fullscreen.html`: activation, promises/events, viewport dimensions, exit and
  iframe policy. Also compare native frames during Escape, tab changes,
  navigation and renderer termination.
- `offscreen-canvas.html`: 2D pixels, PNG, bitmaprenderer, clearing/resizing,
  worker-first GL, WebGL/WebGL2 GPU readback, concurrent contexts, transferred
  placeholder canvases and returned ImageBitmaps.
- `image-codecs.html`: independent fixtures, exact/toleranced pixels and alpha,
  ImageBitmap, JPEG XR MIME/signature and canvas/toBlob/Offscreen encoding.
- `webusb.html`: interfaces, constructors, filters, activation, empty grants,
  DataView identity, subclasses, frozen packet arrays and iframe policy.
  The manual chooser/forget actions perform no transfers.
- `protocol-handlers.html`: validation plus manual registration, approval,
  round-trip URLs and unregister. `tools/bench/protocol-target.cpp` provides a
  native argument recorder; remove its test MIME registration after use.

Automatic pages expose `window.testResults` and `window.testDone`. Fullscreen
entry can be requested with the native Developer Tools; genuine pointer input
is needed to verify the UI-process activation check for the USB chooser.

The html5test.co OffscreenCanvas 2D probe checks
`context instanceof CanvasRenderingContext2D`. The standard uses the separate
`OffscreenCanvasRenderingContext2D` interface; the drawing and readback probes
above verify actual functionality without changing that interface hierarchy.
Its JPEG XR check tests canvas encoding with `image/vnd.ms-photo`, so decoding
alone is insufficient.

Do not change native engine sources or start another engine build while its
ninja is live. Test a frozen bundle with a separate profile, and address only
its returned team/process group. Local task evidence includes
`.vm/issues-final-auto-results.json`, `.vm/issues-fullscreen-integrated-results.json`,
